Latest Version: `0.0.1`

This Python package, `bloombox`, provides an API client for [Bloombox](https://bloombox.io) Cloud APIs. Bloombox APIs are built and served using [gRPC](https://grpc.io) and exposed in client libraries like this one with a more fluid interface to work with.

That being said, you can always opt to use the lower level gRPC APIs, either via gRPC+protobuf (docs coming soon) or via JSON REST, using transcoding (docs coming soon on this too).


### Using the code

Published libs coming soon. In the meantime, see `Building the code`.


### Building the code

Building the code is easy and follows standard Swift packaging conventions. There is also a `Makefile` packaged with various useful routines - you'll use `make` if you are developing on the code.

**Required tools:**
- Python 2.7-3.7
- `virtualenv`
- `git`
- `make` and other CLI tools
- Code access to private schema repos for Bloombox


## Services


### Shop API

The Shop API allows interaction with ordering, user enrollment and verification, and other tools. Demo code coming soon.


### Telemetry API

The Telemetry API allows you to relay events as they happen, so they may be attributed in user flows and other Bloombox-provided metrics.
